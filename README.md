This is a native Android application developed in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose, created as an interview assignment.


##  Features Implemented

- Home screen with user profile Firebase Authentication integration
- Google Calendar API setup (in progress)



## Authentication

The app supports Google Sign-In via Firebase:

1. Click ("Sign in with Google")
2. After sign-in, the user’s name and email are displayed on the home screen


##  Tech Stack

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Firebase Authentication
- Google Sign-In
- (Partially attempted) Retrofit + Google Calendar API

##  Known Issues

- Google Calendar events are not fully displayed yet
- Transcription and chat features were not implemented

##  Final Notes

Due to time constraints and my current skill level,I wasn’t able to complete every feature,but I focused on getting a clean and working authentication experience. I'm still learning and very excited to grow and would be grateful for the opportunity to do so with TwinMind.

Thank you for considering my submission!
